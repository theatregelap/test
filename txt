[(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=0) Traders, welcome to the official master class of the [VWAP wave system toolkit](0c62365e-f18e-43c3-9d88-2231508e56f0). If you've been following my book, my live trading streams or trading inside the [Discord](e687486c-f2cb-44f5-92a7-cd88b25c2553), you know that the VWAP wave system has brought structure and discipline to thousands of traders. And [(00:00:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=18) for years, traders like myself have been piecing the information together manually, drawing out confluence zones, mapping volume profiles on both the lower time frames and the higher time frames, tracking low volume nodes on the intraday and the composits, and looking for the best places to anchor our VWAPs.
[(00:00:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=38) Well, today all of this changes because I'm going to show you how the VWAP Wave System Toolkit pulls all of this information together in a clean, professional, and efficient all-in-one Trading View indicator. In this session, I'll walk you through every single feature step by step. The dashboard that [(00:00:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=59)


instantly tells you whether we're in price discovery or balance on multiple time frames. Automatic initial balance levels with retest and break signals, composite volume profiles with hidden reversal zones, volume climax signals before the trend exhausts, and even an
[(00:01:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=78) onscreen checklist that keeps each trader disciplined. By the end of this master class, you'll know exactly how to use the VWAP wave system toolkit to trade the four core setups, including the four advanced playbook setups from the course and help take your execution to the level that I trade with every single day. So, stick with me. This is [(00:01:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=99) going to change the way you see the market. So, let's dive into the charts. All right, it's 12:30. I am a punctual person, so we're going to get started on time. Welcome everybody to the VWAP Wave System Toolkit Master Class. I'm very excited to be able to share this uh
[(00:01:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=118)


labor of love with you guys. Um my initial intention was never to have a indicator or toolkit. Um I was actually approached by the owner of Flux Charts and he told me that he's been watching my videos and he loves the system. He bought my book. He read the book and he [(00:02:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=138) was super impressed with everything and he said he wanted to create an indicator toolkit around the book. And I was like, "That sounds really cool, but you know, I use a couple of free indicators. I'm not just going to put a couple of free indicators together into a package and charge for it and call it a toolkit." Like, it's it's going to it has to be
[(00:02:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=156) cool and it's got to be worth it and it's got to be unique and it's got to be powerful. And that's where it kind of all started based on that premise. and we sat down and we had uh meeting after meeting and we just brainstormed all the coolest features we can jam-pack into [(00:02:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=173)


this thing based on the system and this is the result and I think it's very cool. I think it's very powerful. Um you know it's it's not a must. You don't need it, right? You can still trade the system just the way we've been trading it for months and even years. Um, but it
[(00:03:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=192) does bring a lot of aspects together that you don't have with the free indicators and it also um it it brings them together on one chart which is really nice uh if you have limited monitors or you just like to [(00:03:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=211) watch one chart. One of the biggest issues I've noticed uh even in my own trading journey is those people those uh traders that get kind of really dialed in on one chart and even though they have a 30 minute and an hourly up they don't look at it right or they have a volume profile up they're not looking at it right we get tunnel visioned on one
[(00:03:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=232)


specific thing and I think this toolkit helps alleviate that it allows you to be able to see all of the pertinent and important information in one spot so you don't easily forget to look at it and we do that and we accomplish that goal in a couple of ways. So ultimately in brief um you know [(00:04:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=252) it's all based on the book on the four core setups and the advanced setups in the VWAP wave system book which has become a bestseller on [Amazon](b667c699-6b44-461c-b4d6-b87663bdf136). Um it's usually in the top 10 in the futures category and as of late it's been around five to seven. I've even seen it in spot four. So very exciting stuff with the
[(00:04:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=272) book and this is just the next stage in the evolution of the system and we're all really excited about it. So um you can hold all questions to the end. We're going to do a Q&A at the very end. Uh you can bring any question you like. Um if you guys can help make sure that um [(00:04:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=291)


anybody who's in the chat if you can assist them with any sound issues because I'm just going to be plowing through information. Um, so usually the common issue is somebody has one of them muted, either the user dries down or the stream. So they just need to make sure
[(00:05:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=308) that the stream is unmuted just to make sure they have volume. So I appreciate it. Okay. Um, so we're going to get started. We're going to start with an absolute blank slate. All right. This is a [(00:05:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=325) twominut chart on NQ. Literally nothing. Blank slate, right? I have white candles for up, black candles for down. That's literally the only thing that's on this chart. All right. To install the indicator after you've made your purchase, it will show up in your invite only scripts
[(00:05:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=346)


and you'll head down to obviously I have a bunch. You're going to head down to the View app wave system toolkit. Once you've purchased, you'll see a green lock next to it. That means you have access and you're just going to click on it once and that will install the indicator for you. [(00:06:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=366) All right, here we go. So, this is how it installs uh to the default, right? This is exactly what you would see. And what I'm going to do to get started is I'm going to turn everything off on the indicator. And we're going to do each one one by
[(00:06:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=384) one. Right? So, I'm just going to turn everything off. You don't have to do that. I'm going to do it just to make this easier for everybody. Uh the only one I'm going to leave access is the watermark. And what that does is that puts this on your screen [(00:06:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=403)


for um anybody who's viewing your screen. They can easily see what symbol you're trading and what time frame you're on. So, I'm just going to leave that one on. All right. So, blank slate. First thing we're going to do is many of you are familiar with the initial balance. All right. This is uh the the
[(00:07:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=421) free indicator that I've had uh on Trading View for quite some time. The addi the only addition we have are these signals. All right. For those of you uh that are not familiar with this indicator, this is the high and low of the first hour of [(00:07:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=439) trading of the regular trading hours. All right, so there's only one initial balance every day per symbol. All right, if it's a US stock market, all right, the regular trading hours for the US stock market are 9:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.
[(00:07:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=458)


Eastern Standard Time. All right. So that is the first hour of trading. All right. Futures are a bit weird. So we have to actually set this to 8:30 to 9:30 because of the CME. It's not just uh with this indicator. This actually happens with built-in indicators as well. So it's not just our indicator. [(00:07:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=479) This is actually happens with all of them. It's a it's a US stock index issue. It's not an indicator issue. All right. And that puts it up on my chart at 9:30 to 10:30. All right, it also plots these extensions. We have a 50% extension, 100% extension, and a 200%
[(00:08:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=497) extension. We also have this middle line, which is an IB midpoint. All right, so this is the IB mid, IB, IB high, 50%, 50% down, 100%. All right, these are measured moves. All right, and each of these can play into the core four setups. If we can break out of an [(00:08:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=515)


initial balance, we can get a price discovery continuation, right? We can fade the value area extremes. Okay. And the way uh up here in the initial balance stats. All right, this is really interesting because this can take the over the last 20 trading sessions.
[(00:08:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=536) So the pretty much the last month, how large of an initial balance we had, how small of an initial balance we had over the last 20 days, what the mean is, right? So the middle one, all right, and today's, right? and it will tell us [(00:09:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=553) whether today's initial balance is big, medium or small as compared to previous initial balances. That gives us some really good insight into the volatility and into the range that we're going to see in today's trading session after the initial balance is set. Now, a common question I get is, well, what about what
[(00:09:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=571)


do I set it to for Asia or if I'm trading London, right? Well, the initial balance is the first hour of regular trading hours, right? The regular trading hours are 9:30 there. So there is no London, there is no Asia. You're going to use these levels throughout London, throughout Asia until we get a new initial balance the next morning. [(00:09:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=592) All right, so it never changes. Okay, the retest breaks and alerts. All right, this allows you to set alerts whether we're going to retest. So, a retest candle means that we broke above it, but we're
[(00:10:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=615) now trading below it. All right? Until we close above, it's going to be a retest until it closes above, at which point it becomes a break, right? Break means we closed above it. Okay? And this means we broke [(00:10:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=633) again. So, we broke above it and then we broke below it, right? That's why we're getting two. Now we're starting to break above. Now we're flat with it. All right. So, this gives us a little indication. It does this for all of the IB levels. Okay.
[(00:10:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=654)


So, you'll see these at the 50% the IB mid and then you can set um you know uh alerts to these as well. So, if you're looking for a break of the IB high or the IB low or the mid, you can get an alert on those. [(00:11:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=674) Okay. So, then you can change, you know, let's say I don't want to see the 50%, I don't want to see the mid, you know, I don't want to see the price levels on it. Um, you know, you can change the tint, you can get rid of the tint, only shows today's tint. So just a little basic
[(00:11:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=692) customizations, you know, to give you whatever it is you want to clean up your screen a little bit. Uh that's all based on your personal preference. Okay, so that's the initial balance. All right, most people are familiar with [(00:11:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=710) that. It's included in here. The addition is going to be the retest alerts, the brakes alerts, and things of that nature. Okay. You also change the colors. You know, I typically like the width a little larger. All right. I keep the the label small. I
[(00:12:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=728)


want to make sure they extend, right? All right. This is really important if you're trading Asia and London because you want these lines to go all the way over to the later sessions. All right. So, make sure these are on. All right. You can change the nature of what the midline looks like. you know [(00:12:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=746) the midline uh is quite um similar to the VWAP right the IB mid you treat it the same way okay so the initial balance can be treated like the four core setups right let's make sure we have an IB mid on this
[(00:12:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=773) all right just to show you right A price discovery continuation on the initial balance high, fade value area extremes off the initial balance, VWAP bounce off the IB mid, right? And then a return to value once we break back into the [(00:13:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=793) initial balance and we trade back to IB mid. So, all four core setups take place on the initial balance combined with the volume profile and the VWAP. All right. Okay. Moving right along.
[(00:13:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=810)


Now, we're going to get into the regular intraday VWAP. All right. It's going to give you a by default a one standard deviation band and a 1.5. All right. You can change this to two. Right? What's going to happen if we add [(00:13:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=831) the color coding? All right. Let's make these drastically different like this. All right. So, if price is trading above the one that's actually I also like to change the way my VWAP looks, right? So,
[(00:14:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=851) I also like to make it a little thicker. All right. I like to make uh those thin. And then I also like to make this blue, this blue, lighten it up a little bit. And then I like to make my intraday orange. Okay. So you can customize all the [(00:14:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=870) colors as well. Okay. So, what happens now, and this is I I love this part of the toolkit, is that when we're trading, oh, also I prefer uh when I'm using the color coding that when we're in balance, everything is white. Okay? Some of you
[(00:14:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=888)


might like that, some of you might not. The choice is yours. I like it. Right? So, when we're trading within the bands, I'm getting nothing but white candles. All right? That's my cue that we're in balance and I should expect choppy and rotational price action. Okay, [(00:15:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=907) so to reiterate, when we're in within the one standard deviation bands, all right, this is where we expect rotational price action and choppiness. All right, when we break above the
[(00:15:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=924) bands, all right, this is where we can expect price continuation. Not always, we get rejections. This would still be a fade value area extreme or return value. All right, but for the most part, if you're seeing green candles, all right, now we're shifting our mind into thinking [(00:15:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=944) price discovery. All right, now there's a lot more to it than that. It's not just green candle buy. All right, it's it's not that simple. I wish it was. It's not it's it's it's never going to be, guys. Um, but it will get you to start shifting and also will keep a lot of people away
[(00:16:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=961)


from shorting. Okay, when we're in price discovery to the upside. Now, if we close above the second deviation band, you'll get a different color candle. All right, we can actually see in previous, [(00:16:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=980) right? You can see where we're red versus orange, green. Okay, yellow means we're above the second standard deviation band. Yellow
[(00:16:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=999) ex, you know, for those of you that also trade extremes, you could also change this to a third deviation or a 2.5, right? Right? If you guys are looking for extreme candles, right? When when is that happening? Right here we got an extreme candle. Right? They don't happen as often [(00:17:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1026) and that will keep you guys on sides. Okay. So, the color coding I think is very beneficial. How do I get that? Uh
[(00:17:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1044) there. Okay. So, I typically uh use the I I I won't have any second standard deviation bands on. I'll keep the coloring the same, right? I'll use orange. And I'll only use one band. I don't need the second band because I know we're above or below [(00:17:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1067)


the second band when I see the color change. Okay, so I kind of can keep my screen a little cleaner. I can easily see at a glance, right? Where am I in balance? Where do I need to be thinking short for a fade value extreme or when we're returning to value, right, to target VWAP or when are we starting to look for
[(00:18:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1088) price discovery continuation? all setups out of the playbook and the color coding really helps people keep people on sides and for whatever it's worth guys you know I know it's something rather simple okay to just change colors but it helps a lot of people stay on sides right [(00:18:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1109) green candle maybe I shouldn't be shorted right there's a lot of people that love to fade the market and something as easy as color coding helps people keep the people that have that issue on sides, right? I won't short until I get white candles, right? I
[(00:18:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1128)


won't short until I get extreme candles that are orange. Okay, so I think that helps a lot of people. Okay, so that is our intraday VWAP. It's going to be anchored to the session open. [(00:19:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1145) We'll have green candles above the one standard deviation band. And then you can define whether you want 1.5, three, and then you'll get a color change above those sigas as well. Okay. So, uh, as we go forward, I'm going to
[(00:19:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1163) keep these, uh, the way I like them. Okay. I could even just have the candle coloring without the VWAP. All right. So, we have a weekly VWAP. All right, you could have one band for that as well. [(00:19:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1182) And then we're going to have the monthly view app all plotted right on your screen. All right, I don't like to have these so dark. So, I'll lighten these up quite a bit so I can see them, but they're not
[(00:20:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1203)


right. Actually, I'm going to put the intraday on as well. So, you can see how all these move together. All right. For weekly, I like to do uh, you know, like a dark green. And you guys can change these to whatever you want, obviously. [(00:20:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1224) And then for monthly, I'll do a purple. And I'll lighten this up as well. Okay. And then what I'll also do here, uh, we need the we'll do no no second
[(00:20:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1242) band. That all right. And then what we'll do here is, um, I like to make these thicker so I can easily see them. So we'll do the weekly. We'll make that thicker. And then what I'll do is I'll make these dashed so I know what they are. [(00:21:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1264) Right. So my I know that green is weekly and dashed just makes it a little easier to discern what's going on. Right. So I can see my weekly VWAP right here. I can see we're approaching
[(00:21:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1282) the monthly VWAP upper band. I can see we're trading above daily and that we have the monthly VWAP and weekly lower band in the same spot. Right? This would be an excellent level to go long from. [(00:21:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1304)


Okay. So, what works in tandem with this is another really cool feature that we built into the toolkit is going to be the dashboard, right? The VWAP dashboard.
[(00:22:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1323) All right, I think this is also very cool. All right, so at a glance, how this works. All right. So, intraday, if it says bullish, that means we're above the intraday VWAP. Okay. If we're below it, it's going to say bearish. For weekly, that means [(00:22:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1343) we're bullish if we're above the weekly VWAP. It'll say bearish if we're below it. And then monthly, it'll say bullish if we're above the monthly VWAP, and it'll say bearish if we're below the monthly VWAP. All right. So, a quick glance, I can see that we're above the daily, the weekly, and the monthly VWAP. Right? Quick glance. Now, there's more
[(00:22:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1364) to it, right? I want to know if we're above or below the upper one standard deviation band. And I want to know if we're above the monthly VWAP or above or below this. Right? So, if we're above the weekly standard deviation band, which is right [(00:23:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1385)


here, right? That's the weekly upper band, right? That means we're in bullish price discovery on the week. Okay. If we're going to be if we're within these two bands in this section here, it'll say balanced market like it
[(00:23:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1402) does on the month. All right. So, with these pieces of information, I can quickly know, all right, if we're bullish on the week, I know that we're above the weekly VWAP and I know that we're above the upper band. Okay, if I see that we're in a balanced [(00:23:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1420) market on the standard, that means I know we're and we're above the VWAP, that means at a first glance, I know we're above the monthly VWAP, but we're below the upper band. Right? So, you can easily see in this
[(00:23:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1437) table without having to look at a higher time frame chart where we're at. Right? And when all of these line up, guys, obviously that's a very powerful bullish signal, right? We're above all the deviation bands. We're above all the VWAPs, man. We should probably be looking for longs, right? Very strong momentum to the [(00:24:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1456)


upside. Same thing with bearish to the downside. And then it'll be some combination of these to try and get some type of confluence and agreement with the immediate direction. And then you can use that for discernment, right? By using our levels on that we're going to get here, right?
[(00:24:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1474) All very important high conviction levels. Okay. So, I love this tool. I think it's very cool using that with our color coding and intraday chart. I feel like this alone is already very powerful. [(00:24:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1493) Super stoked on just this alone. Right. But wait, there's more. Right. So, this is just the VWAP aspect. So, we've covered now the initial balance. We've covered the VWAP, the intraday, and now we've
[(00:25:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1511) covered the higher time frame VWAPs like the weekly and the monthly. Right? These all create create different setups from the four core setups, right? So, if we're just looking at the intraday, right? Let's take let's take the month off and the week, right? Longs to the upside, [(00:25:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1531)


short to the downside. Fade very area extremes when we have a flat VWAP when we're trading mostly in balance like we got a perfect setup there. good shorts, right? And then we have the return to value, right? Where we're
[(00:25:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1549) spending time in price discovery and we go back into value. Okay. Now, out of the advanced playbook, uh we have a couple of setups. Uh you know, one is the fading the initial balance extensions, right? Which I think I skipped over, but [(00:26:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1568) you know, you can fade these levels, especially when they line up. with uh this level as well when they line up with other key levels. All right, so that's one of the advanced playbook setups. Another one of the advanced playbook setups is the higher
[(00:26:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1586) timeframe fade value area extremes. All right, that comes on the weekly and the monthly. All right. So, we have a higher time frame fade value or extreme coming up here on NQ at all right the price right here is 789 [(00:26:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1605)


and a half right that would be a advanced playbook fade right even though we're in a bullish market right this could be a good place to look for a short same thing to the downside
[(00:27:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1622) if we were going to go if we were start selling off. You know, this would be a good long spot because we have monthly VWAP and weekly lower band in the same spot, right? And that's also a very round close to a very round number. 23,500. Love that level for a long if we ever [(00:27:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1639) got down there, at least for a scalp. Same down here. Okay, so that covers uh the VWAPs. All right, let's see what's next in the dashboard. Right, that's the dashboard. Now, you can obviously you can change the the
[(00:27:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1659) customization how it looks. You could put it in the middle center, wherever is convenient toward you, you know, just put that baby up there. Right now, we're going to get into our volume profile. [(00:27:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1676)


All right, we have a session volume profile. All right. So, that's going to open up at the session. HD means it's for one minute candles. All right. Gives you a little more detail on the volume session profile. You can add a value area high and a value area low. Right? One, what time
[(00:28:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1696) the session actually is, right? Do you want up, down, total, the value area, row size, all that kind of stuff. So, here's our volume profile on the session, right? Now this creates our value area high, value area low, right? [(00:28:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1719) So this is a pretty, you know, typical indicator. Where we went deeper with it is what's coming next. All right. Where we went deeper is the ability to enable composite. I'm going to skip over for that for now. I'm going to go right into uh the low volume no uh it's nodes low volume zones nodes.
[(00:29:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1744)


All right. And it can also give us real time. So that's going to give us today's developing low volume nodes. All right. So enabled means the previous sessions, right? How many previous sessions do I want the low volumes from? All right. Let's say I just want the last two sessions. There's too many. you might be [(00:29:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1763) looking at too many sessions, right? So these are key levels, key low volume nodes from the last two sessions, right? And interestingly enough, you can see how price was reacting. All right, this one kind
[(00:29:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1782) of chopped through, but this one, this one, right, especially in Gloveex was reacting to these low volume nodes. Oh, OxyClean is that. And wait, there's more. Right. So, these in and of itself is very powerful. You can also add much [(00:30:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1801)


more levels. If you're if you're not seeing enough, you can kind of play with this a little bit, right? I want to see more levels. So, I'll go back, you know, maybe I'll go back from the last 10 days, right? Give me all the low volume nodes. And then when they're thicker,
[(00:30:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1820) you know, there's multiple days, right? It's even more powerful of a level, right? That was the high we got to at 8:42 in the morning. Fact tested this one. And what you'll also what you'll often find is us trading level to level [(00:30:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1840) on these low volume nodes, right? So, it gives you really good directional insight as to where we can find support when in confluence with some of our other VWAP wave levels, right? All of this stuff is based on auction market theory and the same thing we use to trade VWAP, right? Because a low volume node, just to do
[(00:31:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1861)


some, you know, quick theory here, right? If we create a distribution, right, there's another one here. This is our low volume area. Right? And now price is in fair value and balance until it [(00:31:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1877) materially leaves to create a new value area. Right? So these low volume areas, some of you might have heard them as fair value gaps or what have you, right? These impulse moves, right? This is really price and price discovery from one high volume balance area to
[(00:31:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1898) another. It's all it is. They often act as support and resistance. They're often tested and retested multiple times, right? And then we've added another cool feature. This might be really busy because I have a bunch of them. So, I'm going to slim it down a little bit. [(00:31:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1915) Let's go to the last uh let's just do two sessions. We can add our retests and breaks to it as well, right? And that might be too many. Maybe you just want to see retests. Maybe you just want to see breaks, right? That's
[(00:32:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1935)


up to you, right? Maybe seeing both is too much, right? You just want to see where it's testing to give you a signal, right? And uh just gives you an idea of as price tests this level or closes. If you're looking for a candle close or [(00:32:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1952) confirmation to come in in terms of order flow or you're using tick strike or the cumulative delta, right? keep an eye on these levels and if we're breaking or retesting and closing above it. So very powerful, right? So these are previous days low volume nodes and you can pick how many sessions you want
[(00:32:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1971) to go back, right? So these are low volume nodes from this session, right? Look how price reacts around these levels, right? They don't always hold. Obviously, price would never move if they always held. But usually, you'll see a a break, right? If [(00:33:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=1991)


it hel it held once, then it broke through and back tested. Broke through, didn't back test, we had some type of big move, went all the way back down to this one, straight back up. Right? They don't always hold, right? They're not magic lines that they're always, but these are areas to watch for reactions.
[(00:33:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2010) And when you combine it with other sources of information like the initial balance, the VWAP, the higher time frame value areas, it can be very very powerful. Right now, we can also do this same thing intraday, right? Especially for my scalpers that are looking to take [(00:33:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2029) a lot more trades and a lot more moves. All right, this is going to give us our low volume nodes intraday. Right. We don't have that many in this session. Maybe we can change this by
[(00:34:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2049) multiplying the sess the uh making the criteria a little lower. Right. So, this one doesn't look that great [(00:34:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2066)


currently. I have seen it look really good. We're not getting a good one right now. If I put both on. Here we go. All right. Now I have some good intraday ones. We have this one. And now these are
[(00:34:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2093) developing, right? So, these can move, but they are in real time and they should give you some decent insight into what's happening in the current auction. Um, the low volume nodes are calculated. They look for these peaks and then it tries to draw them on each side of the [(00:35:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2114) peak using calculated percentage. Yes. So very similar to a high value area, low value area. So they they tend to act as I don't want to get too. Let's save the questions to the end because I do want to get through
[(00:35:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2133) all of this and then we can revisit with questions. Happy to answer all of the questions. Yeah. No, it's okay. Yeah, no worries. All right. So that and that's intraday, right? Sometimes this plots out really good levels. I mean, really, we're just looking for these low volume peaks and it draws a line. But you can see, you [(00:35:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2151)


know, as price came back, that was the level it bounced, right? If you guys watch me on stream, I'm always watching for these levels, right? That's I'm always taking profit at them. I'm always looking for a reaction or a bounce, you know, like um as a day trader, an intraday trader,
[(00:36:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2172) you know, it's uh they're really important because that's where the auction can stay for quite some some time between these levels, right? And if you've seen my higher uh my my video on my higher time frame composits, right, this is where we capture multiple days action. All right. So [(00:36:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2191) let's So that's for the intraday and the session intra uh intraday low volume nodes and previous session low volume nodes. Now for the highest conviction low volume nodes. Let's turn this off and we're going to turn on the
[(00:36:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2214) composite. Right. We'll render. All right. And let's say we want the last 10 sessions. Might have to go to a higher time frame. [(00:37:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2239)


This one needs to come off the chart. Hold on. You can't have both the session and the uh it's a limited in drawing ability in Trading View. can't have the session and that at the same time, right? So these are high conviction levels,
[(00:37:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2257) right? Where we expect price to react, right? And you can see price respecting these levels quite a bit. [(00:37:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2274) Doesn't always. It could chop through them or trade around them, right? if it's filling up a zone. These are going to be some of our highest conviction higher time frame levels and these create the higher time frame also out of the advanced playbook fade value or extreme. So this could be another short spot, right? Or if we
[(00:38:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2294) break and retest and go, right? Because these would be your your gaps, your low volume nodes on the higher time frame, right? And this how you draw these or how you decide how many sessions you want to include is essentially based on how much price [(00:38:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2314)


action you need to include here. Right? So we can just go back uh to the 22nd. Right? So we we might not need that many days. Let's let's go back five days. include all of this price action, right? And build me some nodes around that,
[(00:38:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2338) right? So, this this looks like it's a lot more accurate, right? Because it's not including a lot of irrelevant data, right? Broken. Now, it's back testing, right? Right. We got that level held [(00:39:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2357) here, here, here, here. Right now, it says NQ. It can be pretty wicky, but you guys get the idea. All right, these are high conviction, higher time frame levels. And with it, when
[(00:39:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2376) this lines up with something else, very, very powerful. Okay, so you can have this on the screen along with your intraday levels. Where are they matching up? Right. So I could have both my low volume nodes [(00:39:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2395)


from the last five sessions, my higher time frame composite sessions, right? And where where is price the most interesting to me? You know, where am I going to find the most support and resistance? where there gaps right where I can expect chop right because in between low
[(00:40:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2415) volume nodes right you're going to have high volume nodes where price is going to chop right or move back and forth right so once you start understanding those concepts you're going to start seeing some some more visualization cues [(00:40:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2437) from the tool Okay. All right. What else do we have here? We have Let's take off the composite. Let's take off this. All right. We have our checklist. Oh, wait. There's more. All right. We have our volume climax
[(00:40:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2455) feature. All right. This This takes volume climax. So that means when there's an abnormal amount of volume in a candle, let's change it to the two-minute. All right, this gives usually [(00:41:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2471)


a uh it's a quick short-term reversal point. All right, you'll these will be denoted by the red and green circles. That means these are candles with high volume, capitulation type volume. So we usually can fade away from these and then you
[(00:41:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2489) gauge who's control in control after these events from the anchored VWAPs that have been altered a little bit to make a little more sense for our purposes, right? And we ride. So after this capitulatory event that we experienced this morning, we can see [(00:41:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2509) price who's clearly in control after that event. Right? So if you were watching this, right? And you were looking are we going down lower or we're going long, right? This gave a clear long signal
[(00:42:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2528) after that selloff we had this morning after the biggest capitulation candle of that selloff and NQ, right? U maybe it will help you guys visualize this a little more if I add a intraday VWAP to this. [(00:42:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2554)


Right, we got a capitulation long. Right, that marked the high out of the open four minutes after the open. We stayed underneath the VWAP, right? Sellers are in control, right? Then we have another capitulation here at the bottom also IB low showing
[(00:42:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2573) who's in control, right? And this same behavior, you know, right? We're so capitulation. This is at 644. It's after hours, but still works really good. kind of works at keeping you on um on on sides, right? So, we had a capitulation event, short-term reversal [(00:43:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2591) until, you know, there were no buyers left, right? So, we're starting to go lower, right? It wasn't until this capitulation near VWAP where we can get the conviction that we're holding that buyers are now taking the reigns again, right? Back up to fade value or extreme. We tested the upper band, couldn't hold,
[(00:43:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2611)


right? buyers lost control, right? So, it gives us a little another auction lens from these significant capitulation events where abnormal volume stepped in the market. I can tell you right now, this abnormal volume is not retail traders, guys. This is usually the work [(00:43:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2628) of institutions and algorithms and things of that nature. So, they are very important and they're usually designed to throw off retail traders. So that's why we keep track of them and it kind of gives you insight from these significant volume events in the auction.
[(00:44:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2646) Okay? And these tend to act like anchored VWAPs from these significant points, right? And then we can trade any one of these as you know price discovery continuation, right? Return to value, VWAP bounce short, right? [(00:44:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2665)


price discovery continuation, right? All those same setups apply. Another very cool tool that we put in here. So, that's our anchored VWAPs to climax capitulation candles. And you can change the colors, of course. You could also change the volume threshold, right? if
[(00:44:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2689) you're looking for bigger or smaller price capitulations, but this is pretty much the the rule of thumb. Okay, now we have our checklist. Okay, this is another really cool feature. You might have seen this before, but we we threw it in. [(00:45:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2710) For a lot of traders, they have trouble keeping track of everything involved in taking a good trade, right? what really happen what I almost always recommend for traders who are well uh I took this uh price discovery continuation dale but it
[(00:45:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2728)


failed like what did I do wrong and I'm like well did you check the volume profile we had a high volume node right there right we were right at point of control you know that wasn't a great place to look for a long and they go oh no I forgot to I forgot to check the volume profile right so if you have a [(00:45:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2746) simple checklist right up by your screen the entire time. All right, that will make sure that you're checking everything you're supposed to so you don't forget, right? This can be edited, right? Um, unfortunately, you can't click on it right on the screen. That would be really cool,
[(00:46:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2767) but you can't. It's just not possible. So, you would have to kind of keep this up if you actually wanted to do the check mark feature, right? Then you can check them off as you go down. These can also be changed to [(00:46:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2786)


something uh more meaningful to you if these don't make s don't make sense. Okay, so context alignment, you know, this could be, you know, which setup or or whatever, right? So you can change that to something that works for you.
[(00:46:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2804) However, I have designed these for VWAP wave system traders and until you memorize them, there's a explanation here. Oh, there's an explanation here right to the side. Right. So, what does context mean? Are we in trend or balance? Price discovery or fair value? Major renews risk. All right. All right. [(00:47:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2823) Check. Got all that down. All right. Uh auction structure. Are we at anchor VWAP? Are we at an IB level? Value area high point of control. All right. check. Right? What setup am I looking for? Right? Is there multiple structure levels aligning? Do we have an upper band and an initial balance extension?
[(00:47:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2845)


Is there a rejection wick or confirmation of order flow or tick strike? Risk defined. Do I have my stop clearly placed size appropriate? Right? And then you can, you know, have uh, you know, any mix of these that you like. you know, so that's that's up to you, [(00:47:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2866) whatever you want, right? So, just another cool feature there. It's already set up for you based on the system and you can change it accordingly and just keep you on on on par. And last but least, you know, very small little throw in there, just a watermark for if you're
[(00:48:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2884) streaming or recording yourself, you can always easily see the date, the symbol, and the time frame. All right. So, you know, this is the launch, right? We just launched this thing two days ago. We tried to make this thing [(00:48:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2904)


awesome, right? I tried to pack in everything we could think of that was doable. It's I I wouldn't say it's perfect, right? We've gotten a lot of great feedback. There is in the premium [Discord](e687486c-f2cb-44f5-92a7-cd88b25c2553), we have the toolkit uh discussion section for people that are learning it and using it and giving feedback. So, there will be updates.
[(00:48:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2923) We've already made a couple small updates since we launched it. Um, also, you're going to want to make sure you save your template, right? So you can easily use it. Save as a default. So you don't have to change it to how you like it or save it as a theme, right? Because I have a certain [(00:49:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2942) way I like mine. I'm sure you have a way you're going to like yours. Now, there's a ton packed in here, guys. When we turn all of this on, right? It looks like a lot, but it's, you know, in my opinion, I mean, it's it's all important, right?
[(00:49:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2962)


some, you know, if there's major levels, I want to know what they are and where they are, right? And if I'm a a scalper, particularly a leveltole trader, I want to know the key levels that we're between, right? So, I know, right? We have a major level here, and you know, [(00:49:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=2981) I'm not looking long until I'm above it, right? I have no reason to go long here. If we're trading above here, look at all the upside potential I have. This is a much better long if we're holding up here, right? Or I'm not going to short right into this low volume node that's been acting as support previously. I want to see us starting to accept below,
[(00:50:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3000) right? And maybe we'll get to the point of control here, right? Level to level, 10 points, 15 points. Here I can capture 30 points. Big gap, right? This is the spot. If we start trading in here, I'm going to look to fade this back to this low volume node off the composite and VWAP. [(00:50:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3023)


Right? So, yeah, if if there's too much on one screen for you, you can divide it into two charts. You could have your volume profile levels on one chart and your uh, you know, you could just have your VWAP on one, you know, say with your initial
[(00:50:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3041) balance and not have any volume on that chart and maybe on another monitor you have something else to clean it up a little bit. You know, I'm streaming so I only have one monitor that I can share on stream. So, I just throw it all throw it all on there, right? Right. And I've been using it successfully and it works [(00:50:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3059) really, really well. So, that about sums it up, guys. Um, we've been really excited. I think we've had a very successful launch. A lot of we've gotten great feedback and suggestions so far. People really enjoy it. They're it's helping their trading. Um, so I think it was mission
[(00:51:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3077)


accomplished that we set off when we talked about at the beginning of this session. You know, the goal was to not just throw a bunch of easy free things together. The goal was to make something meaningful, something that you can't easily get outside of the toolkit. And I [(00:51:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3095) think we've success. I think I think we've succeeded. I actually think I had I had kind of these expectations which were good, you know. Um when we when I got the finished product, I believe it had exceeded my expectations. So, I was very happy with it. So, at
[(00:51:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3115) this point, guys, we're going to open it up to Q&A. I know there were a bunch of questions and things of that nature. So, um give me a second here while I pull up the uh [Discord](e687486c-f2cb-44f5-92a7-cd88b25c2553) so everybody can see the chat and we'll start doing some some questions here. [(00:52:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3137) All right. All right. So, the chat should now be visible for everybody. That took about an hour to go through that. Take a little drink of water.
[(00:52:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3162)


Okay. So, insight into the retest. Let's use the initial balance for that. You could also use them on the low volume notes. [(00:53:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3184) Okay. Okay. So, right now we have it on breaks, right? Retests. All right. So, this depends on what time frame you're on. All right. I'm on the twominut.
[(00:53:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3212) All right. A break is going to tell me when the close of this candle is above the price level. Right now, I got a break signal. As long as the closed candle, the closed price is above the level, I [(00:53:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3229) get a break signal. And as long as it stays closed, when it finally prints the candle, it will stay there. Okay, so that's the close signal. The the other one is going to be the retest
[(00:54:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3248) candle. That means price went above it and came back. Right? So the close price traveled across the level but the close price is now back below it or above it depending on which which direction we're coming from. Right? So, [(00:54:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3267)


this will count as a retest until price either goes above it, then it'll turn into a break like it did here. Right. So, retest retest retest
[(00:54:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3287) break. So hopefully that helps. It's not the mo, you know, it's nothing much more than that. Retest price stays below close break closes above. So you know if we get both [(00:55:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3310) this is actually an alert, it's a buy alert. Okay, thank you guys. What is the delay after the high volume candle? I mean, it's
[(00:55:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3333) pretty much happens um and it starts happening immediately once the capitulation is is registered. you're gonna start seeing the anchored VWAP start to develop and then it it will stay there until we [(00:55:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3350) get a new one. So you'll keep that capitulation anchored VWAP until we get a new capitulation event. Right? So we have this capitulation candle. It starts printing immediately. Now it's just like any VWAP. not that useful right away, right? You kind of need a little bit of volume. You need a
[(00:56:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3375)


couple of t you need some time to get some real use out of it, right? But once it starts printing for a while, then you'll get some more insight. Just like any Vue app, like when the session opens, you know, the Vue app is essentially useless for a little bit until it develops more. You get more information, but once it does, it's very [(00:56:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3393) powerful, right? So once we had and then we had another capitulation event here. So this one stops printing and we started printing a new one. Juan says it's a re work a piece of art. I agree with you. I think it's very cool. Doc says my biggest question is when you enter on any trade do I have to set a
[(00:56:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3414) stop loss or do you only take a trade with a reaction? If it's a reaction then well so now we're getting into the system right the indic this is the toolkit for the system. So, it sounds like you still need to learn the trading system, which is this. All right. There's a full course. There's the book, and then [(00:57:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3433)


there's a full course in the premium [Discord](e687486c-f2cb-44f5-92a7-cd88b25c2553), which you can trial for a week. So, you can essentially go through the entire course for free. I don't charge for the course. You can access it with the free trial. So, this this master class is not on the
[(00:57:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3452) system. This is on the toolkit. If you have questions on the system, that's a whole another master class. J Scott says, "Much heavier on the discretionary trading, not so much." Yeah, this isn't a signal indicator. Buy here, sell there. Um, I know I know a [(00:57:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3471) lot of people love the idea of that, but you know, there's a gazillion of them and people lose money on them all the time. And there's a reason for that, guys. There's a reason that, you know, buy here, sell there, signal indicators aren't making people buttloads of money.
[(00:58:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3489)


There's a reason because it's incredibly difficult to do. You need to develop the discretion of an experienced trader to be able to use this information appropriately. It's not as simple as green candle buy, red candle sell. If it was, we'd all be millionaires. But it's not. [(00:58:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3509) We don't have them on the deviation bands, Monica. We have them on the low volume nodes and the IB levels. Do we want to add them to the deviation bands?
[(00:58:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3527) This should work the same on the range charts. I mean 100 point range candle is pretty huge, but yeah, uh the the price levels should stay the same. Some parts are going to change, right? like the initial balance won't change, you know, unless you don't print 100 points, you're not going to get a proper initial balance. I would I mean 100 point range is a [(00:59:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3548) little too big, I think. You know, 10 point it would work just fine. Let's switch it over to an eight range, right? I guess it doesn't work. It's got to work on No, it doesn't work on range.
[(00:59:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3569)


Sorry, never never thought of it. It's got to be regular candles, but you can change the times. Works on hyenashi, but not range. [(00:59:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3595) Uh, would this work with Reno charts? Probably not. I don't think this would work with Reno charts. No. Yeah, there's there's there's clear problems with Rankos of why this would not work.
[(01:00:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3624) All right. What are the breaks and retests assigned to? What do you mean? They're assigned to the level. I don't I don't understand what you mean by what they're assigned to. JP, if the indicator is placed on one minute chart, does the monthly VWAP still calculate based on higher time frame candles as trading view does not [(01:00:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3647) provide sufficient one to calculate after about two weeks toward the end of the month. Well, let's see. Let's add the weekly. Let's add the monthly. And let's get rid of the capitulations just to make this clear.
[(01:01:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3681) Okay, we're on the twominut and VWAB had essentially 50 let's say 50 one and 3/4. Yep. Stays the same on all time frames. Let's do the 15 minute. [(01:01:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3704)


Yep. It's right there. So, we checked the two-minute, the five minute, the 15 minutes, and we got the same VWAP, monthly VWAP on all three. All right. An automated checklist would be perfect, you know. Yeah. Or a human being that just do my trades for me, too. That would be cool. You just take
[(01:02:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3723) my money and make me millions. I know. We're joking. I was joking too. Can we use this for trading? You can use this for anything, Jag. I use this for crypto. I've been I trade crypto at 7 o'clock. I'll be on tonight 7 o'clock p.m. trading crypto with it. Um I've used it the last two crypto sessions and I've gotten some really good trades out [(01:02:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3741) of it. So absolutely CFDs is no different. Um you're going to want to use futures data though, Jag. And I actually have a video for that. Um let me pull that up for you real quick.
[(01:02:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3758)


want to make sure that you uh are properly armed with the facts. I did a whole video on that. So, you can absolutely trade CFDs with your broker. You're going to want to use futures data to do it. And this is how you do it. All right. So, I just posted that video. [(01:03:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3784) All right. Where can I get the indicator and how much costs? I think somebody dropped that there for you. It's below. The climax capitulation is awesome. Buy the book. It's Trading Bible. And I've made it not crazy expensive. You You can get
[(01:03:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3802) the ebook for 10 bucks on [Amazon](b667c699-6b44-461c-b4d6-b87663bdf136). If you have any issues or can't buy Amazon, um I even have it now available on for $10 with crypto. So, making it very accessible. I actually have clients in Iran that are not able to buy anything and they can only facilitate [(01:03:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3823)


uh crypto payments. So, I've been working with some some traders in Iran that are sanctioned and they can't pay for this stuff and we've been making it work for them. So, uh the book is accessible 10 bucks at least, 20 bucks if you want the the paperback next to
[(01:03:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3839) you. There's a hard copy which is really nice. up to you guys. I've made it all budget levels. So, if you have 10 bucks, you can you can get it. They are lagging at indicators for the most part. Okay. [(01:04:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3860) Typically, after the IB, how long it takes to my 2020, I don't know what you mean by lagging indicators, right? So, we're measuring volume levels, right? Which isn't lagging. We know we can see the volume in real time and where business is being done and not done. So order
[(01:04:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3877) flow is you know it's indicator would be like a a moving average or it's ba based on old price right VWAP is not entirely lagging because we don't care about the line we just want to know the average price right I know that the monthly average price on all volume that's been [(01:04:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3896)


conducted for the last month is $23,500 right that's not lagging that's the average price all right Uh, typically after the IB, how long it takes to say my day is done? Does it depend on what type of day? Yeah, absolutely. Yep. Every day is going to be different.
[(01:05:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3916) It's going to depend on how well you trade, what your profit target is, how big your account is. There's so many variables in that question. Do you trade ES and [Discord](e687486c-f2cb-44f5-92a7-cd88b25c2553) or just NQ? We watch both. Blackbeard and we start at 9:30 a.m. in the premium Discord and we start at 10:00 am on [(01:05:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3936) [YouTube](9964304c-3e08-4f12-9a86-9695cf70614d), but the YouTube is delayed. Discord is real time, low latency, but we'll mostly trade NQ. It's my favorite. But I've traded the Dow, Russell, ES, um I've traded oil, gold, I trade uh Bitcoin in the evenings or uh Ethereum.
[(01:06:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3965)


It does not BK. It does not allow for changing the source to VWAP, but I I can make sure that they're using the OLC4 source because that's what I use as well. And we're starting to approach that upper band. Monthly upper band. You can see this is monthly VWAP. Monthly VWAP.
[(01:06:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=3995) Yeah, probably. Can it look for divergence like ESNQ? Um, it's an idea. We'll bat it around. See if we can make it. Yeah. Can't do your taxes. No. to use the capitulation view app for context or for confirmation or for targets. I would say all three. It can be it's contextual [(01:06:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4015) because it lets us know who's in control. Um confirmation. It can help us confirm whether we want to be long or short. Not as a entry level confirmation. Um and for t it can be not a target and it also could be a trade trigger location. So, it has lots of uses. It was
[(01:07:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4035)


recorded. Yes, absolutely. Awesome. Victor, enjoy the book. Yep. I'll go over the climax capitulations again. No problem. Now, the the you'll get these on different time frames, right? There's 15 minute. My favorite time frame for this [(01:07:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4057) indicator is uh has been a lower time frame. Five minutes, you don't get as much good detail. I've been having a lot of success with the twominut uh at least with NQ. One minute's a little busy. Two minutes
[(01:07:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4075) not bad. Five minutes is a little too high time frame to get the information I want. All right. So every time there's a capitulation event that is abnormal volume all right usually well over 125% of the [(01:08:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4094) average volume in the most recent candle. So this capitulation it typically denotes a temporary reversal and then it will print an anchored VWAP from the capitulation event. All right, the capitulation events are very important. They're usually liquidity
[(01:08:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4113)


sweeps, stop runs, all right, liquid, just big liquidity events, right? So, they're important and we tag an anchored VWAP to them. This is allows us to see contextually who's in control after the capitulation event, right? So, this is clearly buyers are in control and then we can trade [(01:08:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4134) this like a regular VWAP, right? price discovery continuation longs. The VWAP itself is very important. If we start trading underneath it, buyers have lost control and now sellers are in control. Right? So, it acts both. They're both trade trigger points, confirmation and
[(01:09:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4158) um even the you can even trade the event itself for the temporary reversals. Oh, gotcha. 2020. Yep. Okay. So, when we do an update to the toolkit, it if it's on a previous chart, like a save theme or something, you'll [(01:09:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4185) see a little circle next to the toolkit, meaning you have to update it. If you install it on a new chart, it will automatically be the new version. Yep. I will absolutely. Let me pull up uh
[(01:10:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4206)


Well, this is my this is my chart. This is how I like it. Right. I'm on the two-minute. And then we'll just go through this real quick. So you can because this is recorded, you can just pause it and take a look at my [(01:10:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4225) settings. This will always change the session count, but these are good defaults. Okay. And then I also like to make these thicker. The weekly, the intraday VWAP,
[(01:10:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4245) the weekly upper band, midband, and the monthly. And then I changed them to dotted and dashed so I can easily spot what's going on. Look at that. We have a composite level now with the high of which there's been a [(01:11:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4269) little fade there. small. What happened? I'm gonna try and upload this video tomorrow, Carlos. By tomorrow
[(01:11:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4286) within 24 hours for sure. I do need to do some prep on it. I do want to do a little intro for it. I need to edit it a little bit, not much to clean it up a little bit so it's not just this long. You know, I did some stuff at the beginning I want to get rid of just to clean it up for for more uh [(01:11:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4305)


evergreen purposes. Right. They appear as they're happening, J Scott. So, you'll get the indication quick.
[(01:12:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4327) Safe to assume that your process uses multi-time frame VW apps on a one chart versus using multiple charts with different time frames. Correct? Pulls it all into one chart is one benefit. Autoplotting the levels. So a big part of the system is looking for confluence, [(01:12:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4346) right? Lining up lining up levels from three major auction tools. the volume profile VWAPs, multiple time frame VWAPs, multiple time frame volume profiles to give us really high conviction levels.
[(01:12:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4365) So, it's uh it's I think it's powerful, right? for a system that relies on uh combining so much information to find the best high probability levels. Um I think it makes short work of a a much more laborious [(01:13:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4386) manual process which I think when done manually also extends the learning curve. Whereas I think this tool will help a lot of people integrate these tools properly quicker. And what do I mean by that? I mean that most
[(01:13:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4405)


people, right, when they're just dialed in on one chart, say this chart, right? Right. I'm watching the intraday VW app. I have the initial balance up. I'm staring at this chart, but somewhere else I have volume profile or I might have it up on the screen. I can't I'm not looking at it. I don't know how to [(01:13:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4424) analyze it properly. I definitely don't have a I'm not watching an hourly or a 30 minute chart, you know? I just don't have the ability to compute all of that information yet. It's just a lot, right? All I can really focus is on this one chart. That's where my ability is at. I feel like this tool
[(01:14:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4445) kind of helps bridge that gap a little bit for people that struggle a lot with that skill. And I discovered that uh you know I do a quite a bit of mentorship with people one-on-one and I see that at an ongoing sticking [(01:14:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4463)


point is that people are are having trouble bringing in all the information to make their trade decisions. So hopefully that that explains it. All right, 1:45. We gone out for an hour and 15 minutes. Do we have any other questions while we're still here?
[(01:14:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4486) You guys have been a great audience. Everybody has been very professional and polite. I appreciate it. When I open up a free class to everybody, I I I wasn't sure what I was going to get. So, you know, very very happy that everybody's pleasant and professional and uh just looking to learn and bring [(01:15:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4505) their trading to the next level. Oh, okay. Sorry, Kag missed that one. I joined the premium recently. What were you saying we could do with trying out the indicator setups in the [Discord](e687486c-f2cb-44f5-92a7-cd88b25c2553)? I'm just trying to get familiar with the free ones and working out on Trading View in general for now. Yeah, absolutely. So, all these same things,
[(01:15:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4528)


most of them anyway. Um, you're not going to be able to get uh Climax capitulation anchor view apps. You can try and figure out which ones those are and tag them manually, but there's ways to do this for free. You know, uh you're not going to get the color coding, but you can map out your own low volume modes, and I have videos for all of [(01:15:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4548) that. So, I suggest if you haven't been through the course, go through the course first and then let me pull this over a little bit. You're going to if you're in the premium Discord, uh the these videos here, you're going to go to the video courses
[(01:16:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4569) and then you're going to go to [YouTube](9964304c-3e08-4f12-9a86-9695cf70614d) videos. And there's a ton of stuff here, right? So, you know, this one goes over how to set up various indicators, [(01:16:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4587) using the initial balance, execution, using tick strike, risk-to-reward, cumulative delta. This is about volume profile and low volume nodes. This is how to use the anchored VWAP for like
[(01:16:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4603)


the capitulation candles, right? So there's a lot to know to be able to do it on your own and manually. And that's that was kind of the point of the the toolkit to make it a little easier and bring that all the top down trading blueprint that's combining multiple time frames. Dom scalping is [(01:17:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4620) not you know we believe on crypto. All that stuff. So that's going to be the best. So I think eventually there will be a free trial after the launch. Maybe it's not going to be, you know, maybe it'll be a couple of days or something, but that's much further down the line. Maybe
[(01:17:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4648) eventually we'll do something like that. But for right now, you know, we put a lot of time and and work into it. I didn't develop it. Flux Charts developed it. They spent all their time, money, and resources to develop it. So, uh, you know, I think may one day there will be, but I don't think in the near future. [(01:17:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4671)


And there probably will definitely put together a Black Friday deal. Maybe, possibly. I don't know. was saying I have to convince them too. All right, guys. I appreciate everybody.
[(01:18:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLLSehLntg&t=4692) Appreciate everybody's time today. You've been a great audience. I hope this helps those of you that are interested trade better, trade more consistently and profitably. We've had a lot of students in the group who have read the book.
